  1.give view of yoour small solution
  2.how to form the matrix
 The main take away here is that if our dynamic programming recurrence satisfies the following properties:

    each row only depends on the previous row,
    the recurrences are linear, and
    the recurrences are independent of the row number; in other words, each row is dependent on the previous row in exactly the same way, regardless of the row number,
